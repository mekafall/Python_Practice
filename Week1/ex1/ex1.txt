This is your first excercise in this series, and because of it we'll start it 
easy, first just remembering or praticing some concepts.

Remember, this is NOT an excercise list for COMPLETE begginers, only begginers,
so, if you can't do it, go back two squares...

Proposal:

Make a program that:
1 - Greets the user.
2 - Asks user's name and age.
3 - Put this info in variable named with suggestive tiles like user_name, user_age.

After that...

4 - Print it with some nice phrase.
    But wait! There is more!

    4.1 - [if] this person is younger than 18, it may say something like "Too young!".
           otherwise it ignores this condition (don't use else yet).

5 - At the end just say goodbye calling the user by his name.

I'll give you some hints:

print()
input()
if(somecondition):

 - Hard part on this: Make simple variable names and organize the code propperly.
